Made on September 2024 by Sunmyoung Yun
This is my third mini-game project with C++ & SFML
This was inspired by chrome dinosaur game

2)  Type "make" in VScode terminal

--------------------------------------------------------- GAME PLAY
This is a like the chrome dinoaur game. You have to jump on the bushes, and can shoot bullets or jump from slimes. 
Each obstacle destroyed or not hit will increase score by 1 point. Your aim is to score as much points possible before hitting an obstacle and dying. 

Slimes and bushes get re-spawned by decreasing time intervals. Good luck!
